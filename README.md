# Don't Drop - Reddit Game

## Recent Fixes

### Leaderboard Improvements
We've made significant improvements to the leaderboard functionality:

1. **KV Store Integration**: Updated the KV Store implementation to properly store and retrieve leaderboard data:
   - Optimized leaderboard format and storage
   - Fixed parameters for KV operations

2. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for network and fetch-related errors:
   - Added more detailed error messages in the server logs
   - Improved client-side error handling and display

3. **User Experience**: Improved the overall user experience:
   - Better visual feedback about score saving status
   - Enhanced localStorage backup for usernames and leaderboard data
   - Improved UI animations and transitions

## Known Issues

### Browser Resource Blocks
Some browser errors like `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` are typically caused by:
- Content blockers or ad blockers
- Browser security features 
- Cross-origin restrictions

These don't affect core game functionality and can be safely ignored.

### Fetch No-Op Warnings
The warning `Fetch event handler is recognized as no-op` is related to service worker registration and can be safely ignored in the context of this game.

### Permissions Policy Errors
Errors about `Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature` are related to browser features and security policies. These don't affect core game functionality.

## Deployment Notes

When deployed to Reddit:
- The game will use the KV Store database
- Username detection will work properly
- Scores will be permanently saved to the leaderboard

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the leaderboard not updating:

1. Verify that KV Store is enabled in your Devvit configuration
2. Check browser console logs for specific errors
3. Ensure the username detection is working correctly
